# Chapter 5

- Trust intuition, but verify. - if you have intuition for something, prove it.
- If you think you've defined something, try to also define its opposite.
- It's all a trade-off. There is always a flip side, and looking closely at the trade-offs—in detail, both positive and negative—helps make sure you're evaluating the situation more fully.

# Chapter 6 - Learn Deliberately

- It's less important to know Java, Ruby, .NET, or the iPhone SDK. There's always going to be a new technology or a new version of an existing technology to be learned. The technology itself isn't as important; it's the constant learning that counts.
- Learning isn't done to you; it's something you do.
- Mastering knowledge alone, without experience, isn't effective.
- A random approach, without goals and feedback, tends to give random results
- "...the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting..."
- Set goals. But goals by themselves aren't enough to guarantee your success. Use SMART objectives to meet your goals:
    - Specific
    - Measurable
    - Achievable
    - Relevant
    - Time-boxed
- Allocate time for deliberate learning
- Knowledge portfolio major points
    - Have a concrete plan. Create goals for the next month, year, five years
    - Diversify your attention: books, courses, techniques, etc.
    - Make an active, not passive investment a.k.a. Feedback - you want to always evaluate your plan in the cold light of day and realistically judge how it's going
    -  Invest regularly. You need to make a commitment to invest a minimum amount of time on a regular basis. If you buy stock on a regular basis, sometimes  you'll pay too much, and sometimes you'll get a great deal. But over the long-term, these differences smooth out, and in general you end up getting a good bargain.
- Historically, many educators have differentiated three main types of learners: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (a.k.a see, hear, move/touch)
- Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences:
    - Kinesthetic: Sports, dancing, do-it-yourself projects, woodworking, crafts, cooking
    - Linguistic, Logica: Verbal arguments, storytelling, reading, and writing
    - Mathematical, Visua: Math, numbers, sciences, taxonomies, geometry
    - Spatial: Using diagrams/plans, sketching, painting, manipulating images
    - Musical: Playing music, recognizing sounds, rhythms, patterns, remembering slogans and verses
    - Interpersonal: Empathic; senses feelings, intentions, and motivations of others
    - Intrapersonal: Self-reflective; works from an understanding of inner feelings, dreams, and relations with others
- Personality Types. Google around and find various online surveys and quizzes  so you can identify what sort of learner you are
- Discover how you learn best.
- Form study groups to learn and teach.
- Enhanced Learning Techniques
    - Better ways to deliberately read and summarize written material
    - Using mind maps to explore and find patterns and relationships
    - Learning by teaching
- The technique of studying a book or other printed matter is known as SQ3R
    - Survey: Scan the table of contents and chapter summaries for an overview
    - Question: Note any questions you have
    - Read: Read in its entirety
    - Recite: Summarize, take notes, and put in your own words
    - Review: Reread, expand notes, and discuss with colleagues
- Read deliberately.
- Test-Driven Learning
    - Reading the same material over and over, or studying the same notes over and over, doesn't help you remember the material. Instead of studying, try  esting. Repeatedly testing yourself by trying to recall the material over and over works much better.
- Take notes with both R-mode and L-mode.
- Writing documentation for documentation's sake is a waste of time.
- Write on: documenting is more important than documentation.
    - Hand-drawing the cards emphasizes R-mode processes
    - The active creation of the notes/cards helps prepare the mind for the later activity
    - Visualizing the sequences and maneuvers can help "groove" the mind
- Learn by Teaching
    - Talk to the duck
    - See it. Do it. Teach it.


# Chapter 7 - Gain Experience

- Build to learn, not learn to build.
- Fail efficiently with better feedback.
- Groove your neural pathways for success.
- Play in order to learn
- A flight attendant gave preflight speech in rhymes. Because it was fun, the presentation was much more effective. Fun is OK.
- Play more in order to learn more.
- When faced with a sticky problem, there are a couple of classic approaches you'll probably take.
    - First, can you break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts
    - The other very popular approach to take is to look for any similar problems you may have solved previously. Is this problem like some other?
- You need to unlearn just as much as you need to learn. Learn from similarities; unlearn from differences.
- Debugging is a part of life—not just software. Lawyers have to debug the law, mechanics debug cars, and psychiatrists debug us.
- "Errors benefit us because they lead us to study what happened, to understand what went wrong, and, through understanding, to fix it."
- "I don't know" is a good start, but don't let it end there.
- Explore, invent, and apply in your environment—safely.
- Things you need in order to experient:
    - Freedom to experiment
    - Ability to backtrack to a stable state
    - Reproduce any work product as of any time
    - Ability to demonstrate progress
- Learn About the Inner Game. The tennis experiment with the old lady
- We learn best by discovery, not instruction.
- Cultivate Situational Feedback
- See without judging and then act.Fight the urge to rush to judgment or to a potential fix prematurely. Be fully aware of how the system is behaving, and only then decide what part of that is "wrong" before moving on to devise a solution
- Deadlines panic the mind. "... you are the least creative when you feel time pressure. Not only are you less creative when battling the clock, but there's a sort of after effect: a time pressure "hangover"." What's worse, you're shutting out most of the R-mode entirely: it's the L-mode that handles time. When you perceive time as being critical, the R-mode can't get a chance to work at all.
- Give yourself permission to fail; it's the path to success.
- The story of a bass instructor. Many of his very talented students would simply freeze up in the spotlight and not perform at their best. He explain that the judges weren't ready yet. They were still working on paperwork from the last candidate. The microphones weren't even on. So go head, he'd say, and just run through the piece once as a warm-up. Of course, he was lying through his teeth. The students performed excellently. They were free to. They were explicitly given permission to fail.
- Legendary jazz guitarist Pat Metheny takes this idea one step further and offers this advice: "Always be the worst guy in every band you're in. If you're the best guy there, you need to be in a different band. And I think that works for almost everything that's out there as well."
- We are natural mimics.
- Groove your mind for success.
- Ruby programmers might work in something like C++ for a while. C++ makes a very effective mental equivalent to heavy ankle weights; after working in C++, more dynamic languages then feel a whole lot easier by comparison. :-)
